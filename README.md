# reutilizationCalculator
About this plugin:
This plugin is made to calculate Reutilization potential of lands.

How to use it:
First, load the plugin and let it populate fields in the attribute table.
Then, when you're ready, select a polygon, open the plugin and fill out the form.
The form will return to you a condition, reutilization option, and a score.

the resulting reutilization might look like this:

Urban Farm --> Farm to Table

The first term is what the land is classified now, and the arrow is what it can be used for.
